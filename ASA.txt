  route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 1 track 1

  !--- Enter this command in order to track a static route.
  !--- This is the static route to be installed in the routing 
  !--- table while the tracked object is reachable.  The value after
  !--- the keyword "track" is a tracking ID you specify. 

  route backup 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.51.100.2 254

  !--- Define the backup route to use when the tracked object is unavailable. 
  !--- The administrative distance of the backup route must be greater than 
  !--- the administrative distance of the tracked route.
  !--- If the primary gateway is unreachable, that route is removed
  !--- and the backup route is installed in the routing table
  !--- instead of the tracked route. 
  
  sla monitor 123
   type echo protocol ipIcmpEcho 4.2.2.2 interface outside
   num-packets 3
   frequency 10

  !--- Configure a new monitoring process with the ID 123.  Specify the
  !--- monitoring protocol and the target network object whose availability the tracking
  !--- process monitors.  Specify the number of packets to be sent with each poll.
  !--- Specify the rate at which the monitor process repeats (in seconds).

  sla monitor schedule 123 life forever start-time now

  !--- Schedule the monitoring process.  In this case the lifetime
  !--- of the process is specified to be forever.  The process is scheduled to begin
  !--- at the time this command is entered.  As configured, this command allows the
  !--- monitoring configuration specified above to determine how often the testing
  !--- occurs.  However, you can schedule this monitoring process to begin in the
  !--- future and to only occur at specified times.
  
  !
  track 1 rtr 123 reachability

  !--- Associate a tracked static route with the SLA monitoring process.
  !--- The track ID corresponds to the track ID given to the static route to monitor:
  !--- route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.2 1 track 1
  !--- "rtr" = Response Time Reporter entry.  123 is the ID of the SLA process
  !--- defined above.
